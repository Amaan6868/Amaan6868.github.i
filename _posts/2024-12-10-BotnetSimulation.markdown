Welcome to my Botnet Simulation project! This Python project simulates a botnet with capabilities to execute UDP flood attacks. It comprises two main components: a bot script and a command-control server. You can find the linke to this repository [here](https://github.com/Amaan6868/BotnetSimulation).
