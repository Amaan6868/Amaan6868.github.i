SoundSpace is a social media platform for music lovers. Users can rate and review songs, discover highly-rated tracks, and explore detailed reviewsâ€”all in one place. While ratings and reviews are open for everyone to see, only registered users can contribute by signing in to create their own ratings and reviews. The app is built with a focus on seamless user experience, leveraging modern technologies and best practices. You can find the link [here](https://github.com/Amaan6868/SoundSpace).
