ECommerce is a microservices-based application designed to manage projects, products, customers, and orders. This project integrates these functionalities into a cohesive search service that combines and utilizes data from all other services. This application is built as a learning project, based on the [Azure Microservices with .NET Core for Developers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/azure-microservices-with-dot-net-core-for-developers/making-sense-of-microservices-architecture-in-a-dot-net-core-and-azure-ecosystem?resume=false&u=106240434) tutorial from LinkedIn Learning.
