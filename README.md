Hi, I’m Amaan Afzal, a passionate and driven <strong>full-stack developer</strong> currently in my final year of Computer Science at John Abbott College. I specialize in building modern, scalable applications and solving technical challenges. My projects include a .NET Core <strong>eCommerce App</strong> with microservices architecture, a <strong>Calendar App</strong> built in C# with event scheduling, and a <strong>Social Media Platform</strong> developed using TypeScript for song ratings and comments. I’m proficient in a wide range of tools and technologies, including <strong>C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Node.js, SQL, and ASP.NET Core</strong>. I’m preparing for my final-year internship next year, where I aim to apply my skills to real-world challenges. I’m committed to continuous learning, collaboration, and delivering innovative solutions that bridge technology with user needs.
